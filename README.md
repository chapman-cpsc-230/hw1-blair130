**Author:** _\<Lucas Blair\>_

**Due date:** _\<2/19/2016\>_

## Description

_\<I had to make three programs and upload them to GitHub. One program computed interest rate, one computed a formula involving sine and cosine, and the other program could tell whether a baby will live to a billion seconds.\>_

## What I Learned from This

_\<I learned how to import functions and variables from the math folder of python.  I also learned how to upload to a repository on GitHub.\>_

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

_\<Lucas Blair\>_
